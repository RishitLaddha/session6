def docstring_checker():
    '''
    Returns a closure that checks if a function has a docstring with more than 50 characters.

    The returned closure takes a function as input and verifies if its docstring
    has more than 50 characters. The minimum length of 50 characters is stored as
    a free variable within the closure.

    Returns:
        function: A checker function that takes another function and returns
                  a message indicating whether the docstring length requirement is met.

def fibonacci_closure():

    Returns a closure that generates the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.

    The closure maintains the state of the Fibonacci sequence, with initial values
